Testing MCP Stemformatics Functions with Claude

To test the MCP Stemformatics functions with Claude, you can use the following requests:

1. Search for datasets:
   Ask Claude: "Can you search the Stemformatics database for datasets related to 'dendritic cell'? Use the MCP function to search datasets."

2. Get dataset metadata:
   Ask Claude: "Please retrieve the metadata for dataset with ID 2000 from Stemformatics using the MCP function."

3. Get dataset samples:
   Ask Claude: "Can you get the samples for dataset with ID 2000 from Stemformatics? Use the MCP function to get dataset samples."

4. Get dataset expression:
   Ask Claude: "Please retrieve gene expression data for gene ENSG00000118513 in dataset 2000 from Stemformatics using the MCP function."

5. Search for samples:
   Ask Claude: "Can you search for samples related to 'dendritic cell' in Stemformatics? Use the MCP function to search samples with a limit of 10 results."

These requests should help test if the MCP integration with Stemformatics is working correctly. If there are any errors, Claude should provide information about what went wrong.

Tips for making requests:
- Be specific about which function you want Claude to use
- Start with simple queries that return small amounts of data
- Specify limits on result sizes when possible
- Ask Claude to format the results nicely (e.g., as a table or list)
